# a quatrain a day...

## Hope you like it!

I was not much of a great UX designer in that I had no plan making this. I worked on it whenever I've gotten into states of flow to code or an idea popped up, with the general idea of cute self-care website for Michael. So yeah some things need refining, but since I've *finally* figured out how to use git I can keep pushing new feature changes and the site will update itself automatically.

**So let me know what you think of it and if you have any qs!**

## About

The poem generator retrives a random four-lined poem from the PoetryDB API. It generates a new quatrain each time you load the page.
Here's the API, if you're interested: https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb

There's also what I'll call the note element *(Michael,...Farah x)*. It shows a different message depending on the time of day you open it. I'll let you find all the messages. I'll also let you find out what the *Unblock your chakras* does.

The site also changes color depending on the time of day, automatically going into dark mode if you open it at night.ðŸŒ™

### "A penny for your thoughts" ðŸ’°

The *"a penny for your thoughts"* button links to a thought record form. The form is based on a mix of CBT sheets I've worked with and a therapy bot called Woebot. The responses are then recorded on an Airtable, and you can categorise them by feelings, themes, cognitive distortions etc. You can view and edit the Airtable and form by clicking the *"View all your recorded thoughts"* button. Thought it was a more enjoyable user experience than just filling in a table, with the benefit of being able to wrangle some thought/mood patterns once there are enough responses, since having it as an Airtable also makes it into it's own API. (Like thought quote cards or even a personalized data viz coming soon? We shall see...)
