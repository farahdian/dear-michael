# a quatrain a day...

for personal use <3

There are only three compenents to this web app:

1. a simple clock
2. the quatrain generator
3. the "a penny for your thoughts" feature

The poem generator grabs a random four-lined poem from the PoetryDB API. It generates a new quatrain each time you load the page.
Here's the API if you're interested: https://poetrydb.org/index.html

The "a penny for your thoughts" button links to a thought record form. The form is based on a mix of CBT sheets I've worked with and a therapy bot called Woebot. The data is then posted to an Airtable that will record each submission.

There's also what I'll call the note element(Michael,...Farah x). It shows a different message depending on the time of day. I'll let you figure that one out ;)
