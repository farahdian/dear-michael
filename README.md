### Quick note on viewports

It's best viewed on a laptop. I haven't tested out desktop view as much, leaves some empty space but it still suits it. If you intend to view it on your phone, turning it landscape is best. It's still legible in portrait view but not as pretty.

## About

### The web app has 3 components:
```
1. a simple clock üï∞Ô∏è
2. the poem generator üìù
3. the "a penny for your thoughts" feature üí≠
```

The poem generator grabs a random four-lined poem from the PoetryDB API. It generates a new quatrain each time you load the page.
Here's the API, if you're interested: https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb

There's also what I'll call the note element *(Michael,...Farah x)*. It shows a different message depending on the time of day you open it. I'll let you find all the messages.

The site also changes color depending on the time of day, automatically going into dark mode at night.

### "A penny for your thoughts"

The "a penny for your thoughts" button links to a thought record form. The form is based on a mix of CBT sheets I've worked with and a therapy bot called Woebot. The responses are then recorded on an Airtable. Of course I'll be transfering base ownership accordingly. Thought it was a more enjoyable user experience than just filling in a table, with the benefit of being able to wrangle some thought/mood patterns once there are enough responses, since having it as an Airtable also makes it into it's own API. (Like thought quote cards or even a personalized data viz coming soon? We shall see...) I'm also thinking of "adding a penny" each time a form is filled that will log onto the main page.

## I hope you enjoy it!

This is my first proper GitHub project where I've *finally* figured out how to use git. So yeah some things need refining, but the beauty of it is I can add new changes and the site will update itself automatically.

**So let me know what you think of it and dm if you have any qs! Or feature requests lol XD**
